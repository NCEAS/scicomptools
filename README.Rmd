# `scicomptools`

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `scicomptools` is to house all of the standalone functions written by NCEAS Scientific Computing Team staff that lack a specific project. Currently contains various tools to import, summarize and analyze data

## Installation

You can install the development version of scicomptools from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("NCEAS/scicomptools")
```

## Current Functions

-   **`zoom_webinar_fix()`**: Processes the raw CSVs output by Zoom after a webinar (handles both the attendance and post-webinar survey dataframes)

-   **`word_cloud_prep()`**: Performs text mining on a given text column of a dataframe to create a dataframe that is ready for word cloud creation.

    -   Note that there is also the companion function `word_cloud_plot()` that performs the mining *and* creates a simple `ggplot2` word cloud (for those who don't want to handle their own plotting aesthetics)

-   **`stat_export()`**: Exports a tidy CSV of summary statistics of a supported statistical test. Currently the following tests are supported: `lmerTest::lmer()`, `stats::lm()`, `stats::nls()`, and `stats::t.test()`

- **`csv_summary()`**: Convenient wrapper for running `Hmisc::describe()` on a CSV and exporting the result as another CSV

- **`categorical_frequency()`**: Counts the frequency of levels of all categorical variables in a given dataframe
